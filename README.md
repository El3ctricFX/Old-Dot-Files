# GNU Stow

within this repo i have used gnu stow to link all my config files into 1 directory.

s/o to [yawn3k](https://github.com/yawn3k?tab=repositories) for helping with hyprland, zsh, and GNU Stow

# Setup files

the files within /setup-files/ are in a testing stage which will more then likely replace your current config files that could break systems so becareful!
